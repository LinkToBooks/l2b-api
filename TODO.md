# TODO

- should 'formats' be renamed 'offers'?

- should retryDelay be changed to something that can be truth tested to see if it should be applied, rather than "is defined"?

- create cron jobs (update geoip db, update exchange rates)

- create a sample development config

- document how to set up project for local dev

- list packages needed on the server (redis, geoip)

- compression
